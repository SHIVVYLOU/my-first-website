## Testing and info on  different Software Development programs

The pages you will find here are a series of logos and links
to several Web Development programs such as HTML, JAVASCRIPT & PYTHON.
The coding was competed using cloud9 and then then it was saved locally and later 
pushed to a remote database at GitHub. Git is a program that we use to log and save 
our code. To store it safely and later provide live links for kexternal viewing and also 
so that other team members that we may be working with can view our code.
